# Giannis-Antetokounmpo-Shooting-Analysis

With the help of the [nba-api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) library (great for grabbing raw NBA stats) and [a nifty script for drawing the lines of a basketball court](http://savvastjortjoglou.com/nba-shot-sharts.html), I analyzed all shooting data from Giannis Antetokounmpo's nine years in the NBA.

giannis-shooting-analysis.ipynb contains the analysis. draw_court.py, as its name suggests, draws a court in a matplotlib plot.
